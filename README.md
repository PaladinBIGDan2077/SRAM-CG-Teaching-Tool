## Current Status
IN PROGRESS

## Project Overview

This project will demonstrate to the end-user how SRAM is used to store data within a computer, how changing BITs will have an effect on the output of the visualized character. (The development of a PAL will be likely be needed to output ASCII-based character map, possible future implementation), but for now will used 

## Educational Value Added

It provides insight to how character generator ROMs work, which were quite common in the days of early home computing. This will lead to a further understanding of ASCII based decoding. Storage of certain bits will allow the character rom to display individual characters on an LED Matrix, which will allow the viewer to write a message on screen letter by letter. A Binary Counter will be used to scroll through memory addresses, and a buffer will be used to display the current data to write to memory, as well as entry of a specific memory address.
